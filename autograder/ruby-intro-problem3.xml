<p>
  Define a class <code>BookInStock</code> which represents a book with
  an isbn number, <code>isbn</code>,and price of the book as a
  floating-point number, <code>price</code>, as attributes.   The
  constructor should accept the ISBN number (a string) as the first argument and
  price as second argument, and should raise `ArgumentError` (one of
  Ruby's built-in exception types)
  if the ISBN number is the empty string or if the price is less than or
  equal to zero.
  <p>Include the proper getters and setters for these
  attributes. Include a method <code>price_as_string</code> that displays
  the price of the book with a leading dollar sign and trailing zeros,
  that is, a price of 20 should display as "$20.00" and a price of 33.8
  should display as "$33.80".
  <p>Please put the class in a single file and upload it using the upload form below:</p>
